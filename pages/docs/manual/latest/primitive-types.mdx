# Primitive Types

ReScript comes with the familiar primitive types like `string`, `int`, `float`, etc.

## String

ReScript `string`s are delimited using **double** quotes (single quotes are reserved for the character type below).

```res
let greeting = "Hello world!"
let multilineGreeting = "Hello
 world!"
```

Special characters in the string need to be escaped:

```res
let oneSlash = "\\"
```

To concatenate strings, use `++`:

```res
let greetings = "Hello " ++ "world!"
```

### String Interpolation

There's a special syntax for string that allows

- multiline string just like before
- no special character escaping
- Interpolation
- Proper unicode handling

```res
let greetingAndOneSlash = `Hello
World
\
${name}
`
```

This is just like JavaScript's backtick string interpolation, except without needing to escape special characters.

For interpolation, you'll have to convert the binding (`name` in the example) into a string if it isn't one. If you want the interpolation to implicitly convert a binding into a string, prepend a `j`:

```res
let message = j`Today I am ${age} years old.`
```

### Usage

See the familiar `Js.String` API in the [API docs](/apis/latest/js/string). Since a ReScript string maps to a JavaScript string, you can mix & match the string operations in both standard libraries.

### Tips & Tricks

**You have a good type system now**! In an untyped language, you'd often overload the meaning of string by using it as:

- a unique id: `var BLUE_COLOR = "blue"`
- an identifier into a data structure: `var BLUE = "blue" var RED = "red" var colors = [BLUE, RED]`
- the name of an object field: `person["age"] = 24`
- an enum: `if (audio.canPlayType() === 'probably') {...}` [(ಠ_ಠ)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLMediaElement/canPlayType#Return_value)
- other crazy patterns you'll soon find horrible, after getting used to ReScript's alternatives.

The more you overload the poor string type, the less the type system (or a teammate) can help you! ReScript provides concise, fast and maintainable types & data structures alternatives to the use-cases above (e.g. variants, in a later section).

## Char

ReScript has a type for a string with a single letter:

```res
let firstLetterOfAlphabet = 'a'
```

**Note**: Char doesn't support Unicode or UTF-8 and is therefore disrecommended.

To convert a String to a Char, use `"a".[0]`. To convert a Char to a String, use `String.make(1, 'a')`.

## Regular Expression

ReScript regular expressions compile cleanly to their JavaScript counterpart:

```res
let r = %re("/b/g")
```

A regular expression like the above has the type `Js.Re.t`. The [Js.Re](/apis/latest/js/re) module contains the regular expression helpers you have seen in JS.

## Boolean

A ReScript boolean has the type `bool` and can be either `true` or `false`. Common operations:

- `&&`: logical and.
- `||`: logical or.
- `!`: logical not.
- `<=`, `>=`, `<`, `>`
- `==`: structural equal, compares data structures deeply: `(1, 2) == (1, 2)` is `true`. Convenient, but use with caution.
- `===`: referential equal, compares shallowly. `(1, 2) === (1, 2)` is `false`. `let myTuple = (1, 2); myTuple === myTuple` is `true`.
- `!=`: structural unequal.
- `!==`: referential unequal.

ReScript's `true/false` compiles into a JavaScript `true/false`.

## Integers

32-bits, truncated when necessary. We provides the usual operations on them: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, etc. See [Js.Int](/apis/latest/js/int) for helper functions.

**Careful when you bind to JavaScript numbers**! Long ones might be truncated. Bind JS number (especially Dates) as **float** instead.

## Floats

Float requires other operators: `+.`, `-.`, `*.`, `/.`, etc. Like `0.5 +. 0.6`. See [Js.Float](/apis/latest/js/float) for helper functions.
