# Standard Library Overview

- [Js](/apis/latest/js): all the familiar JS APIs and modules are here! E.g. the [JS Array API](/apis/latest/js/array).
- [Dom](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Dom.html): contains DOM types. The DOM is very hard to bind to, so we've decided to only keep the types in the stdlib and let users bind to the subset of DOM they need downstream.
- [Node](https://bucklescript.github.io/bucklescript/api/Node.html): for node-specific APIs. Experimental; contribution welcome!
- [Belt](/apis/latest/belt): extra ReScript data structures & helpers. This module provides useful functions in addition to the JS libraries above that you're used to.
