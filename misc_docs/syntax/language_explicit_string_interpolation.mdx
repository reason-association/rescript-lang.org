summary: "This is the explicit `string` interpolation syntax."

An explicit `string` interpolation is composed of two backticks. It works like JavaScript's backtick string interpolation without the need to escape special characters.

### Example

<CodeTab labels={["ReScript", "JS Output"]}>

```res
let language = "ReScript"

let exclamation = `${language} is pretty cool.
Right?
ðŸŽ‰
`
```

```js
var language = "ReScript";

var exclamation = language + " is pretty cool.\nRight?\nðŸŽ‰\n";
```

</CodeTab>
