## Team Update

It has almost been a year since we originally [launched our new ReScript brand](/blog/bucklescript-is-rebranding), and we think it has been a pretty successful journey so far:

- An all new documentation experience
- Relaunch of `rescript-react` and its new docs
- Release of our re-imagined VSCode & Vim plugins
- New syntax, compiler and build system improvements, including `pinned-dependencies` and better incremental build performance
- Improved interop with improved polymorphic variant representations for numbers and strings
- A greatly simplified object system (no need for `Js.t`)
- Making every part of ReScript fully Open Source and therefore independent from any company politics
- The release of our new `rescript` npm package and cli to replace `bs-platform`
- etc. 

Of course there many more things to come in the near future, and we wanted to make sure to keep track of our main goals in a more reliable and transparent way.

### New Roadmap and Release Cycle Plans

We had some thorough discussions about the future of the project and outlined the most important milestones for the next upcoming releases.

**We also settled on a release cycle plan to give a better overview on estimated releases:**
- Two release channels: `stable` and `experimental`
- More predictable release dates and better migration steps
- Better communication and discussion for breaking changes
- Helps the community / companies to align on major stable versions

The detailed roadmap with all our planned changes (and definition of our release cycle plan) can be found in our [community / roadmap](/community/roadmap) section.

### New Landing Page

After several iterations, and lots of desperate days of designing and copywriting, we are happy to announce that we are finally releasing our new landing page.

This is an incredible milestone for the documentation, and will act as a foundation for some cool new future improvements, such as:

- Highlighted Case Studies from production users such as Beop or Rohea
- An interactive playground widget for the headline code examples
- New starter templates and guides


Furthermore, in case you are a **production user of ReScript** and you want to see your company logo highlighted on the landing page, please [open an issue](https://github.com/rescript-association/rescript-lang.org/issues) and let us know!

Happy hacking.
